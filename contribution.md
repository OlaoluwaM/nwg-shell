# Contribution

If you like the idea, feel free to submit your improvements, new modules or plugins. You can also propose your own program as a part of the shell, if you think it fits.

## Pull requests

1. Before you open a PR containing substantial changes to already existing programs, please open a [Discussion](https://github.com/nwg-piotr/nwg-shell/discussions).
2. Half-baked PRs won't be merged: 

- **Make sure you don't introduce new bugs**. We already have enough bugs to fix.
- **Make sure your work is finished**, and needs no futher effort to be usable.
- **Remember, that the project is intended for users of all skill levels**. Explain your new feature to the user. Add tooltips where needed. Update README / Wiki.

## Issues

Open an issue in appropriate GitHub repository to report a bug or request a feature.

## Translations

As of the nwg-shell-config 0.4.19 version, all the own (non-third party) shell components are supported by a common translation engine.
Since I don't really like gettext, which would be an overkill here anyway, I decided to create my own simple system based on JSON format.
The base en_US lang, as well as pl_PL translation are provided together with each program. Other translations depend on contributors.

If you'd like to improve translations, or add your own, please find the "Translate" button on the nwg-shell-config main screen:
