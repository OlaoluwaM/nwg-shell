# Alternative launcher: [nwg-menu](https://github.com/nwg-piotr/nwg-menu)

If you've recently parted ways with Windows, you may miss the menu button. This launcher will help you acclimatize. It displays the system menu with simplified [freedesktop main categories](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/menu-spec/latest/apa.html). It also provides the search entry, to look for installed application on the basis of .desktop files, and for files in XDG user directories. You may pin-up applications above the categories list. In the bottom-right corner of the window you'll also see a set of buttons: lock screen, logout, restart and shutdown.

Due to limited interest, the development of this launcher may be discontinued in the future. Enjoy while you can. ;)
