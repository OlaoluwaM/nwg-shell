The installer provided in this repository pulls all the necessary dependencies, and preconfigures [4 desktop
styles](https://github.com/nwg-piotr/nwg-shell-config/blob/master/README.md#desktop-styles) for you to choose from. Each of them you can modify freely from the nwg-shell-config GUI. Or you may choose the 'Custom' preset to experiment with.

# Support for other WMs

This project is primarily aimed at sway. Some parts may work on other wlroots-based compositors. Some may even work on X11, but it's not the primary objective. Feel free to submit addons / improvements, but keep in mind that all the stuff **must** work on sway, and **may or may not** work elsewhere.

## Pull requests adding support for non-sway stuff 

are welcome.

## Feature requests like "add <place_your_wm_here> support"

go to `/dev/null`.

# Contributions

If you like the idea of the GTK shell for sway, feel free to submit your improvements, new modules, plugins or standalone programs. Preferred languages are python and Go.

**Important: before you open a PR containing major changes to already existing programs, please (PLEASE!) open an issue to discuss what you're going to do.**

## Feedback

Bug reports and ideas are more than welcome. Please remember, however, that at this stage, most part of the shell is being developed by a single hobbyist, 
who uses Arch Linux. Some issues specific to other environment, e.g. Debian, FreeBSD, are out of my range and need some Community commitment.
