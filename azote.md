Azote is an image browser with options useful when using them as wallpapers: clipping, mirroring, splitting between displays. For setting the background, the program uses Drew DeVault's [swaybg](https://github.com/swaywm/swaybg) (sway/Wayland) and Tom Gilbert's & Daniel Frieselfeh's [feh](https://feh.finalrewind.org) (X windows) commands. The user interface is being developed with multi-headed setups in mind. Azote also includes several colour management tools, as e.g. color picker or palettes creation on the basis of an image.
