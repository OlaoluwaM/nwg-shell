Nwg-look is a GTK3 settings editor, designed to work properly in wlroots-based Wayland environment. The look and feel is strongly influenced by [LXAppearance](https://wiki.lxde.org/en/LXAppearance), but nwg-look frees the user from a few inconveniences, by applying setting directly. It provides changing gtk themes, icon themes, cursors, and also tuning some other GTK settings.
