This program is a GUI to configure all the components in one place, together with the most essential third-party applications. This involves significant interference with the basic sway config, using included files, that are modified on the fly from the GUI level. Even though you no longer need to edit "dotfiles" manually, you can still do it if you need to (not recommended for beginners).

Nwg-shell-config allows to set the common sway preferences (screen, input devices, idle and lock screen configuration, main applications key bindings), as well as switch between predefined desktop styles. Each of the above may be adjusted to user's taste, that includes placement of the application drawer, dock, exit menu, and notification center.
