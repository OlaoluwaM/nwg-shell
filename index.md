# nwg-shell project

**The nwg-shell project aims to create a consistent GTK3-based user interface for the [sway](https://github.com/swaywm/sway) Wayland Compositor. In order to give the user the greatest possible choice, some interface elements provide several alternative solutions. Just installed shell contains a bunch of presets, which can then be freely modified.**

The user interface mostly consists of dedicated software, but also uses a couple of great third party products ([swaync](https://github.com/ErikReider/SwayNotificationCenter), [gtklock](https://github.com/jovanlanik/gtklock)), that perfectly complement our vision. Many thanks to their authors for favorable attitude towards feature requests.

The default (preinstalled) terminal is [foot](https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot). This does not mean that we consider other terminals worse, but that we had to choose one. The remaining elements of the desktop environment, such as the text editor, file manager or web browser, and so on, are left to the user's choice. The author's subjective recommendation might be mousepad, Thunar, and Chromium / Chrome, but it doesn't really make much difference.

On the backend side there's a lot of third party Free Open Source Software. We will try to list them all in Credits.

## Panel: [nwg-panel](https://github.com/nwg-piotr/nwg-panel)

Authors: Piotr Miller & [Contributors](https://github.com/nwg-piotr/nwg-panel/graphs/contributors)

License: MIT

The panel is the central point of the project. At the moment it contains 12 modules: BrightnessSlider, Clock, Controls, CustomButton, Executor, MenuStart, OpenWeather, Playerctl, Scratchpad, SwayNC (integrates Eric Reider's [SwayNotificationCenter](https://github.com/ErikReider/SwayNotificationCenter)), SwayTaskbar, SwayWorkspaces and Tray. The Executor module supports tint2-like executors, that allow to display user-defined content. The MenuStart module adds support for the nwg-menu launcher.

The Controls drop-down window provides brightness & volume controls, and switching audio outputs. It also includes user-customizable menu items.

## Application launcher: [nwg-drawer](https://github.com/nwg-piotr/nwg-drawer)

Authors: Piotr Miller & [Contributors](https://github.com/nwg-piotr/nwg-drawer/graphs/contributors)

License: MIT

The `nwg-drawer` command displays the application grid. The search entry allows to look for installed applications, and for files in XDG user directories. The grid view may also be filtered by categories. You may pin applications by right-clicking them. Pinned items will appear above the grid. Right-click a pinned item to unpin it.

## Dock: [nwg-dock](https://github.com/nwg-piotr/nwg-dock)

Authors: Piotr Miller & [Contributors](https://github.com/nwg-piotr/nwg-dock/graphs/contributors)

License: MIT

The author's personal preference is to see the running tasks in the nwg-panel's SwayTaskbar. If you prefer to use a dock, however, this may be the choice for you. Nwg-dock features pinned buttons, task buttons, workspace switcher and the launcher button. The latter by default starts nwg-drawer. The dock may be placed on the bottom, top or left side.

## Alternative launcher: [nwg-menu](https://github.com/nwg-piotr/nwg-menu)

Author: Piotr Miller

License: MIT

If you've recently parted ways with Windows, you may miss the menu button. This program, which is also an nwg-panel plugin, will help you acclimatize. It displays the system menu with simplified [freedesktop main categories](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/menu-spec/latest/apa.html). It also provides the search entry, to look for installed application on the basis of .desktop files, and for files in XDG user directories. You may pin-up applications above the categories list. In the bottom-right corner of the window you'll also see a set of buttons: lock screen, logout, restart and shutdown.

Due to limited interest, the development of this launcher may be discontinued in the future. Enjoy while you can. ;)

## Notification Center: [swaync](https://github.com/ErikReider/SwayNotificationCenter)

Author: Erik Reider

License: GPL v3

This program provides the notification daemon and a GTK-based user interface for managing notifications. Nwg-shell integrates swaync, adding a panel notification icon and configuration options in own config utility.

## Screen locker: [gtklock](https://github.com/jovanlanik/gtklock)

Author: Jovan Lanik

License: GPL v3

The shell uses gtklock as the default locker in the Idle & Lock screen settings. We add a random image background (local or from unsplash.com), and (optionally) a media player control window over the lock screen.

Alternatively, as a locker you can use the well-known [swaylock](https://github.com/swaywm/swaylock) by Drew DeVault.

## Wallpaper management: [Azote](https://github.com/nwg-piotr/azote)

Authors: Piotr Miller & [Contributors](https://github.com/nwg-piotr/azote/graphs/contributors)

License: GPL v3

Azote is a picture browser and background setter, as the frontend to Drew DeVault's [swaybg](https://github.com/swaywm/swaybg) (sway/Wayland) and Tom Gilbert's & Daniel Frieselfeh's [feh](https://feh.finalrewind.org) (X windows) commands. The user interface is being developed with multi-headed setups in mind. Azote also includes several colour management tools, as e.g. color palettes creation on the basis of an image.
